3. **Interactive Examples**: Each widget is interactive - try tapping, dragging, or swiping
4. **Performance**: All animations are optimized for smooth 60fps performance

## 🔧 Technical Features

### Performance Optimizations

- **Efficient Animations**: Using `AnimationController` with proper disposal
- **Memory Management**: Proper widget lifecycle management
- **Smooth Rendering**: 60fps animations with optimized rebuilds
- **Lazy Loading**: Widgets are built only when needed

### Best Practices Implemented

- **State Management**: Proper use of StatefulWidget and StatelessWidget
- **Animation Lifecycle**: Proper initialization and disposal of controllers
- **Code Organization**: Modular structure with separate showcase files
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- **Material Design 3**: Modern UI following latest design guidelines
