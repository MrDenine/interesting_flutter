}
```

## 📱 How to Use

### Navigation

1. **Home Screen**: Browse through 8 widget categories with animated cards
2. **Category Selection**: Tap any category to explore detailed widget examples
3. **Interactive Examples**: Each widget is fully interactive:
   - **Tap** buttons and cards for animations
   - **Drag** elements to see position tracking
   - **Swipe** for gesture-based interactions
   - **Scroll** in data tables (both horizontal and vertical)
   - **Sort** table columns by clicking headers

### Special Features

- **2-Directional Scrolling**: Data tables support both horizontal and vertical scrolling
- **Real-time Animations**: All animations run at 60fps with smooth transitions
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Material Design 3**: Modern UI with dynamic theming

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimizations

- **Memory Management**: Smart widget rebuilding and state preservation
- **60fps Rendering**: Optimized animations using `TickerProviderStateMixin`
- **Lazy Loading**: Widgets instantiated only when needed
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking operations for smooth UI

### Architecture & Best Practices

- **Modular Structure**: Each widget category in separate files
- **State Management**: Proper use of StatefulWidget patterns
- **Animation Lifecycle**: Comprehensive controller management
- **Code Organization**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Navigator 2.0**: Professional routing with custom page transitions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and error states
