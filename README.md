## 🏗️ Clean Architecture Implementation

The project follows proper Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

### Architecture Structure

- **Domain Layer**: `lib/domain/repositories/` - Abstract interfaces defining business contracts (no GraphQL dependencies)
- **Data Layer**:
  - `lib/data/datasources/` - Concrete GraphQL implementations that implement domain interfaces
  - `lib/data/repositories/` - Simple delegation layer that coordinates between domain and data sources
  - `lib/data/models/` - Data transfer objects for API responses
- **Presentation Layer**:
  - `lib/presentation/screens/spacex/` - UI that depends only on domain interfaces
  - `lib/presentation/providers/` - Riverpod providers for dependency injection and state management
- **Core Layer**: `lib/core/services/graphql/` - Generic GraphQL utilities (framework-agnostic)

### Key Benefits

- ✅ **Repository is an abstraction**, not a concrete implementation
- ✅ **GraphQL code is isolated** in data sources, not mixed with business logic
- ✅ **Domain layer is clean** and independent of external frameworks
- ✅ **Easy to test** by mocking interfaces instead of concrete classes
- ✅ **Swappable implementations** - can replace GraphQL with REST, local storage, etc.

See [CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE.md](CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architectural documentation.
